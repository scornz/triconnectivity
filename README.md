> A set of generic implementations for finding $3$-edge-connected and $3$-vertex-connected components in a graph (implemented in Python). Made for junior-year independent work for Princeton University's COS Department.

## Abstract

This paper explores the implementation and application of a well known $3$-edge-connectivity algorithm. We use Tsin's algorithm to analyze, in linear time, the connectivity of essential networks [[1](#1)]. This includes state-wide road networks, distributed systems, and even the structure of the Internet. Implementations and applications of $3$-edge-connectivity are relatively unexplored, and this paper aims to fill a gap in the surrounding academic literature through rigorous explanation and demonstration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) or PyPy ([download](https://www.pypy.org/download.html))
- `pipenv` (call `pip install pipenv` globally)

## Setup

1.  Ensure requirements are installed correctly.
2.  Navigate to project folder.
3.  Call `pipenv install` to install required `pip` packages into the virtual environment.
4.  Prosper.
